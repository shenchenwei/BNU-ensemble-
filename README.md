# BNU-ensemble-
This project is for ensemble verification. 
The code in the project is written by matlab, and I try to change it to the python or fortran.
I want to build a ensemble forecasting system with initial perturbation (data assimilation) and stochastic physical perturbation. 
I also want to do someting to improve the prediction ability of WRF,like xinzhong liang.
